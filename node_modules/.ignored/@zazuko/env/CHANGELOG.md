## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a9b5fb3: Missing peer dependencies on types

## 2.0.0

  1. The additional factories have been removed from the `create` function.
  2. To create a derived environment, use the constructor overload which takes a parent environment as the second argument in addition to the array of additional factories.

  For example,

  ```js
  import env from "@zazuko/env";
  import Environment from "@zazuko/env/Environment.js";
  import MyFactory from "./my-factory.js";

  const myEnv = new Environment([MyFactory], { parent: env });
  ```
